# 64 byte NVMe, Read command (a NVM command) that is suitable for:
#       sg_raw --cmdfile=<this_file_name> --nvm --request=2048 <nvme_device>
#
# The address field (at byte offset 24, 8 bytes and little endian) gives
# special meaning to the highest address pointers:
#    ffffffff fffffffe         use address of data-in buffer
#    ffffffff fffffffd         use address of data-out buffer
#
# The data length field (at byte offset 36, 4 bytes and little endian)
# gives special meaning to the highest block counts:
#    fffffffe                  use byte length of data-in buffer
#    fffffffd                  use byte length of data-out buffer
#
# 512 byte logical block size is assumed. Read 4 blocks hence 2048bytes.
# The first LBA read is 0x12345 and the namespace is 1. If successful
# the four blocks will be read into the data-in buffer. Submission queu
# 0 is used (the same queue that Admin commands use). The NVM opcode for
# the Read command is 0x2 and appears in the first command byte.

# Notice NVMe uses its quirky "0's based" number of blocks so
# 03 appears at byte offset 48 to mean "read 4 blocks".
#
# A typical invocation in Linux and FreeBSD would look like this:
#    sg_raw --cmdfile=nvme_read_ctl.hex --nvm -r 2048
#           --outfile=t.bin /dev/nvme0
#
# Notice the '--nvm' option which is needed to distiguish a NVM
# command from an Admin command as Admin commands are the default
# in this utility.
#
# This utility (and most others in the package) aligns data-in and
# data-out buffers to the beginning of pages which are 4096 bytes
# long at a minimum. This is the way NVMe likes things as well.

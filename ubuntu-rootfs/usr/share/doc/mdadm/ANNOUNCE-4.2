Subject: ANNOUNCE: mdadm 4.2 - A tool for managing md Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to finally announce the availability of mdadm-4.2.
get 4.2 out the door soon.

It is available at the usual places:
   http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/mdadm/mdadm.git

The release includes more than two years of development and bugfixes,
so it is difficult to remember everything. Highlights include
enhancements and bug fixes including for IMSM RAID, Partial Parity
